# salary--prediction
Salary prediction project  using  Python , Pandas , NumPy , and Scikit-learn with regression algorithms.  
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on relevant input features.
It involves systematic data preprocessing, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset.
Feature selection and engineering techniques are applied to improve the performance of the predictive model.
Various regression algorithms are implemented and evaluated to determine the most accurate model.
The model is trained and tested using appropriate performance metrics to ensure reliability and effectiveness.
The project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning concepts in real-world salary estimation scenarios.
Overall, this system provides a structured and data-driven approach to salary prediction.
